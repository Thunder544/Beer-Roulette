# Beer-Roulette
Beer roulette made using the Bottle for Python web framework (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html). You will need Bottle in order to run this application. ('pip install bottle' in linux environments)

The game is drinking, and the winner is whoever "spins" the roulette wheel for beer! This is meant to be a way to choose what beer to drink when you have too many types on hand. If you're like me and do beer tastings, it comes in very handy when deciding what to taste next. But use it how you like! The only rule is drinking!

## Usage
Run the python file in a folder containing the '.tpl' files, the '.css' files, and the python file. It will start hosting the website on your localhost on port 8080. In order to see it, in a modern web browser navigate to "http://localhost:8080". 

The site will load with directions on the screen asking you to enter your beers. Once you enter all the beers you have, click "choose" and the application will randomly select one from the list. Once your session is complete, the page will change and you will have the opportunity to go back to the home page and start all over!
