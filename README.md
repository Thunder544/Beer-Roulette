# Beer-Roulette
Beer roulette made using the Bottle for Python web framework (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html)

The game is drinking, and the winner is whoever "spins" the roulette wheel for beer! This is meant to be a way to choose what beer to drink when you have too many types on hand. If you're like me and do beer tastings, it comes in very handy when deciding what to taste next. But use it how you like! The only rule is drinking!
